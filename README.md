# InterfaceOS

InterfaceOS is an AI-native Design Intelligence Platform connecting visual design, design tokens, components, patterns, documentation, accessibility, code, governance, and machine-readable knowledge.

## Project status

The repository is in **IOS-001 Stage 1 implementation** status. The code-side token foundation is under review; Figma execution and release remain blocked by milestone entry gates. No UI components or product application have been implemented. See [IOS-001 — Design Foundations and Token Architecture](docs/roadmap/ios-001-design-foundations.md).

## Sources of truth

- **Figma:** editable visual intent and design evidence.
- **Git:** versioned specifications, tokens, schemas, code, documentation, governance, tests, and release manifests.
- **Storybook:** implemented component behavior, previews, accessibility checks, and code examples.
- **Supabase:** operational workflow data after its data model is approved.

Conflict and synchronization rules are defined in the [source-of-truth model](docs/architecture/source-of-truth.md).
